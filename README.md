This project pulls weather data from the weatherstack API (documentation seen here: https://weatherstack.com/documentation). The main peice of data we are looking at is the UV index, but we also pull: Cloud coverage, Temperature, and 'Feels Like' data.

This project is still in development. I need to add styling, further logic, and decide if I'd like to host it.
