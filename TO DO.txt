TO DO:

- Create styling with CSS.
- Add logic with JavaScript to offer a real suggestion... like if certain value is over X, then yes... and "don't get tricked by cloud coverage today".
- Add ability to input Location variable... or at least drop down of major cities or something... handle that in some way that will teach ou something.
